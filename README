= Scopes, a collection of named_scopes for ActiveRecord

ActiveRecord's named_scope feature allows you to define partial queries
which can be chained together and result in a single (more or less)
complex SQL query.


== Installation

In your application's root do:

$ git submodule add git://github.com/jazen/scopes.git vendor/plugins/scopes


== Features (available scopes)

* published
* drafts

* least_popular
* most_popular

* latest
* limit
* order
* paged


== How to use

Let's take a Post model for example - with columns published_at and priority. 
This would find you the 5 most popular published posts:

Post.published.most_popular.limit(5)
